Today i have done a project regarding the inventory using concepts like objects class,interface,inheritance.
This project contains a objects like vehicle or books so that that can be purchased or rental based.
I have gone through the module video and done a sample project using abstract class .
Bank Poject:
 1.we have created the data fields that are given and created a new class according to the flow chart and created the constructors and set the properties
 2.In the constructors we have override the constrcutors for abstract constructor and done a chaining constructors 
 3.We have created the methods according the flow chart.

SQL:
DBMS-Data base Management System
  it is a software used to manage the database.
  it basically serves as an interface between the database and its end users.used to retrieve,update and manage the data.

there are 4 types of dbms
 1.Hierarchial
 2.Network
 3.Relational
 4.Object oriented

1.Heirarchial-it showcase the predices and successor type of relationship
its like a tree in which nodes represents records and branches represents field

2.Relational-data is stored in the form of tables

3.object oriented-i this everything is represent in a object it contains data and instructions to be done with the data
4.Network-multiple users data can be link
